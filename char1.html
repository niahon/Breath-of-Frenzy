                <h3>Ryu</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Ryu is the protagonist of Breath of Fire 1. He is the base that all subsequent Ryus follow: a young blue haired male who wields a sword and is part of the Dragon Clan/Brood, being the chosen one to defeat a great evil. He originally had no name, but he has been referred to as "Ryu" in every rerelease and subsequence official matterial of the franchise.</p>
                    <p>In this game, Ryu is a descendant of the Light Dragon Clan. He can transform into different elemental dragons, but these forms are only unlocked as the player progresses in the game. Even further beyond, he gets the ability to fuse with all party members and become the ultimate dragons: Rudra and Agni. Having lost his parents at a very young age, he now lives with his sister in one of the few remaining villages of the Light Dragon Clan. After they're attacked and his sister kidnapped, he sets out on an adventure to find her, and ends up finding out that the Dark Dragon emperor Zog is the one who ordered the attack on his village, and plans to dominate the world by freeing the goddess Tyr from her slumbers, by acquiring the 6 Goddess Keys that were used to seal her in the first place.</p>

                <h3>Nina</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Nina is the heroine of Breath of Fire 1. She is also the base for all of her subsequent incarnations: a young blonde girl who is profficient at magic and the princess of Wyndia, and constantly implied to be in love with Ryu.</p>
                    <p>In Breath of Fire 1, she is first seen when Ryu arrives in Wyndia, concerned for her father, who was poisoned by the Dark Dragon clan after refusing to side with them in the war. She sets out with two guards to try and find a cure for her father's ailment, and reaches the Dark Dragon Clan Wizard's experiment chamber, but ends up being defeated.One of the soldiers comes back and informs Ryu of this. Ryu then goes after the Wizard and manages to defeat him, saving Nina and getting the antidote for the king, with Nina accompanying him on his journey afterwards.</p>
                    <p>Near the end of the game, Nina is drawn into a time portal and sent many years into the past. She's then cared for by a couple, until the party ends up finding her again in the present, where she rejoins as an adult and now has the ability to turn into a Great Bird and fly.</p>

                <h3>Gilliam</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Gilliam is a member of the wolf-like Forest Clan. Even though he has an intimidating appearance, he is a kindhearted and devoted friend, and is often depicted as a sort of big brother figure to the younger members of the party.</p>

                    <p>Before the start of the game, the Dark Dragon clan drove Gilliam's clan out of their home land, who ended up in the town of Tantar as refugees. But the Dark Dragons continued to harass them, because they wanted the Ring in possession of the Forest Clan. When Ryu and Nina reach the town, they find it in the midst of a drought, as the Dark Dragons have blocked the river. They investigate the Dark D. Fort, hoping that there they can find a way to help the Forest Clan people. Unfortunately, they end up being trapped by one of the enemy Generals, who was mascarading as a Tantar resident. Gilliam manages to help them escape, and they destroy the rock that was blocking the river and Bo agress to accompany Ryu and Nina in their journey.</p>

                <h3>Karn</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>When he was a kid, Karn was found in Bleak by the leader of the Thieves guild. As he is an orphan, he knows absolutely nothing about his parents and his hometown. In spite of that, Karn is completely uninterested in his past, wishing only to dedicate himself to his thieving abilities, as he is always practicing his skills. The guild leader knows about his past, and wonders if he should tell Karn about it, but ends up not doing so. The party finds him in a prison in Auria, but he only joins the team in Krypt.</p>
                    <p>As he is a thief, his field abilities involve things such as pick locks and disarm traps. He can also fuse with several of his allies(which is never explained by the story), which makes him one of the most important party members.</p>
                    <p>He has a cameo in Breath of Fire 2, where he can be found in an island to the northwest of the first Shaman's house, living with Bo, which serves as good evidence of Breath of Fire 2 being a followup of the first game.</p>

                <h3>Manillo</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Gobi is part of the Manillo race, which forms a clan of notoriously greedy merchants, whose objective is to one day control all of the world's commerce, which is facilitated by the fact that their main areas of work are any places that touch the sea.</p>
                    <p>Even for the standards of his clan, Gobi is excessively greedy, having sold fake Happiness Jars, and being punished by having his shop license and his Sphere(which allows him to transform into a Big Fish, important for traversing the oceans) taken away from him.</p>
                    <p>The party finds him in Auria, after their ship is destroyed and they're found stranded in an island. Gobi offers to help them for the price of a Golden Bar, and you control him alone for this section, exploring underwater and managing to find the Gills necessary for the other characters to breathe underwater. </p>

                <h3>Ox</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Ox is a member of the Iron Ogre clan, and he has a wife who's six months pregnant. He is first seen in Prima, where the boss named Morteo is trying to kill him. After the party defeats him, Ox reveals that all the young men in Gant, the city where he lives, are being imprisoned by the Dark Dragon clan in order to build them a powerful weapon. He joins the party in order to free his people, and helps finding shortcuts to avoid the guards in the Hidden Fort, by using his strength to destroy rocks in their path. They manage to free the males of his clan, but find out that by the time the party arrived, the weapon was already built, and sent to a different place, along with the women of his clan, being held as hostages as a guarantee that the Iron Ogre clan wouldn't go after them.</p>
                    <p>The party reaches Nabal Castle, where they succeed in freeing the women and also Ox's wife, but fail with the weapon, as it was already sent in a boat to attack the town of Prima. Ox decides to leave his pregnant wife in their hometown, so he can join Ryu in fighting against the Dark Dragons.</p>

                <h3>Mogu</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Mogu is a part of the Dirt-Eating clan, that built their world underground and live there peacefully. They don't ever appear in the frontlines throughout history, but it is known of their ability to dig thousands of meters every day. They're a small but powerful race, and Mogu himself is silent and shy, but in fights, he is proven to be a powerful and courageous warrior.</p>
                    <p>His tribe was enslaved by the Dark Dragons, and they were forced to dig up the ruins of the Obelisk. During this, Mogu was attacked by Mote, a member of his own tribe, and had his psyche split apart in a sort of dream world, so he couldn't help Ryu and company to go to Spyre and get the Sky Key, important for their progression. The party ends up managing to acquire a special artifact that allows them to go into Mogu's dream world, and rescue him by defeating the demon Mothro. After he is rescued, Mogu joins the party and helps them advance into the Dark Dragons' territory.</p>
