                <h3>Ryu</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Ryu is unsurprisingly the protagonist of Breath of Fire 3. As a member of the supposedly extinct Brood, he can transform into several dragon forms, by the use of mystical genes found throughout the game. As he is one of the only Brood members left, he has to endure the task of finding out why God wanted his people exterminated in the war.</p>
                    <p>He is found as a child by Rei, and taken care by him alongside Teepo. He helps the two in their thieving errands for a while, until they're targeted by a criminal organizaion and end up separated. His objective is then to find Rei and Teepo, and in the second half of the game, find out more about his past and descendants, and why they were targeted by the goddest Myria.</p>
                    <p>In this game, he and Nina have a very close relationship. He is very protective of her and cares a lot about her, going to extremes when needed, in order to save her from danger. Garr notes that Nina is the main reason why Ryu uses his Brood powers, and she manages to pry all this information out of him, where she promises to get stronger so he won't get into danger by revealing his powers to others.</p>
                    <p>In game, Ryu can wear any heavy armor, and has a big amount of spells, both for healing and for support, at his disposal. All that, combined with his physical stats and his ability to transform into incredibly powerful dragons, make him the strongest character in the game </p>

            <div class="grid">

                    <a href="images/bof3/nina3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/bof3/nina3.jpg"></a>
                </figure>
                <h3>Nina</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>When she was a kid, Nina was very trusting and naive, but still clever, and knows how to acknowledge when she's made a mistake. She is also determined, since she never lets any kind of problem stop her, which becomes even stronger when she becomes an adult. She also believes strongly in all of her friends and is loyal to them, especially Ryu. She has family issues, as she ran away from her kingdom multiple times in order to help her friends, but despite that she still loves her family, even if she has a stronger connection to Ryu and company.</p>
                    <p>Nina is really close to Ryu, and has an immense faith and loyalty to him, always supporting him no matter what situations they find themselves in. Nina just sees Ryu as her hero, and isn't afraid at all of his Brood powers, even knowing how dangerous they are, especially for the fact that he tends to use them to protect her, something that she finds out later on in the game.</p>
                    <p>In game, Nina follows the archetype of her previous incarnations, being the spellcaster of the group, with high AP and Intelligence, but low physical stats. Unfortunately, as she is very frail, and most bosses resist the spells she can use against them, she ends up being the least important member of the party, being nearly as irrelevant as Breath of Fire 2's Nina.</p>

                <h3>Teepo</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>At the start of the game, Teepo and Ryu live under Rei's care, and the three of them go out stealing from the villagers. After their house is burned down and they're sepparated, Teepo is assumed dead for the majority of the game.</p>
                    <p>He's eventually found by Ryu's party five years after the event, under goddess Myria's care. He reveals to be able able to turn into a dragon, just like Ryu, and begs for him to confine himself in that refuge, just like Teepo did years ago, concealing his powers. As Teepo knew would happen, Ryu refuses, and defeats Teepo in a battle, ending his life. Just before he dies, his final words are him wishing that he could have lived together with Ryu and Rei, his family. </p>
                    <p>In the end of the game, Myria confirms that Teepo was also a member of the Brood, being a fellow clansman to Ryu. However, unlike Ryu, he agreed with Myria that the Brood was too powerful to be kept alive, and accepted having his powers hidden and being confined in Eden for all of eternity, living with Myria for all that time. </p>

                <h3>Rei</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Rei describes himself as a kid at heart who doesn't know when to give up. During his time as a thief, he was a very calm person, but sometimes showed a more impulsive side. He prefers not to hurt other people, but will more than gladly attack others in order to protect Ryu and Teepo, which shows his protective nature, and how he's well described as a big brother figure. After the 3 of them are separated, Rei believes that both Rei and Teepo died, turning him into a vengeful and devastated person.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the story, Rei lives with Ryu and Rei, taking care of them, and teaching them how to survive. The three of them were really disliked by the villagers, as they often stole from the village people. That was until they were forced by Bunyan to help the village on a dangerous errand, which increase the respect they had there. Afterwards, They're tricked into stealing the tax money from the mayor and giving them back to the villagers, but find out that he was a part of a criminal organization, which burns down their house and defeats them, which separates the group.</p>
                    <p>After this, Rei swears to get revenge upon the crime syndicate that ruined their lives, his anger strengthened by him thinking that both Ryu and Teepo were dead. Eventually, Ryu and the party find Rei, after the timeskip, where Rei is fighting against the syndicate, and says he's surprised to see how strong Ryu has become. In the end, Rei destroys the organization and kills their leader, Mikba, subsequently rejoining Ryu's party.</p>

                <h3>Momo</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Momo is a scientist who holed herself up in a tower after her father's death, wishing to finish his incomplete research on a special ore called "Chrysm". She is a natural genius, and very tech savvy, although this ends up making her an arrogant person, boasting that her father's research is perfect and infallible. Still, she is a very kind person, and wishes to discover different ways to help the world with all of her knowledge and research.</p>
                    <p>She is first introduced when Ryu and Nina take refugee in the tower she's still in. After she finds out the situation they're in, she's determined to help them escape from their pursuers, since she's the only person who knows the tower's design in detail. Once they escape, Momo finds an old friend called Palet, who asks for her help with a certain "mutant" problem in The Plant. After this, she finally joins the party for good. Palet ends up betraying them and selling them to Ryu and Nina's pursuers, but they manage to escape imprisonment and follow through with Ryu's quest. </p>
                    <p>In the game's second half, Momo follows Ryu and his friends to discover the origin of the machines that wash up on the shores of the Eastern World. Momo plays a much larger role and is required at practically every location, as she is the only character that is tech savvy. </p>

                <h3>Peco</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Peco is a sort of onion-like mutant, found in The Plant. He is unable to speak, provenient from his low intelligence(also represented in game in his Intelligence stat), only being able to make incomprehensible noises. Despite that, he is able to understand the situations the party finds itself in, and when Ryu speaks to him he can infer what he is feeling from his expressions and reactions.</p>
                    <p>Peco was born from the remains of the mutant boss in The Plant, after the party defeats him. Immediately after that, he joins the party, which makes them able to talk with Yggdrasil through him, since he's a grassman.</p>
                    <p>In the end of the game, it is revealed that Peco has the power of Yggdrasil running through him, and he manages to twart Myria's efforts to destroy the party. After the party defeats her, Peco(as Yggdrasil) begins to return life to the Desert of Death. </p>

                <h3>Garr</h3>
                <div class="char-desc">
                    <p>Ryu meets Garr during the Contest of Champions, where they fight in the finals. Garr ends up as the winner, and as a prize for the Contest, he chooses Ryu and his party, which annoys Balio.</p>
                    <p>Once Ryu wakes up, Garr speaks with him, and tells him that he held back during their battle, since he wants to take care of Ryu. Afterwards, Garr tells Ryu he's a member of the Brood, a now extinct dragon clan, and that he must travel to Angel Tower if he wants to find out more about his identity and powers. </p>
                    <p>Garr is part of a race created by goddess Myria in order to exterminate the Brood clan. He was the most powerful out of the four guardians created by her, gathering the most kills. Garr sided with Myria because he thought that was his purpose, as that's what he was created for, but he has doubts if that's really what he should have done, and during the events of the game he finds out that the Brood were extremely powerful, and could have easily defeated all of them, but chose to go down peacefully, which instill a major guilt upon him. In the end of the game, after Myria is defeated, Garr chooses to stay behind so he can atone for his wrongdoings, which results in his death.</p>
